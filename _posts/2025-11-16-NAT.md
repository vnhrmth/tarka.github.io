# What is NAT (Network Address Translation)?

Every device in the local network have an IP address,  
e.g. 192.168.1.2 etc  
whenever we use our browser from mobile to request a page via the internet  
we use the HTTP protocol.  
this request goes to the home router which has a public IP Address  
which communicates to the web server to retrieve the required web page  
and then fetches this page.  
The router then sends the response back to the device where the request originated.  
e.g. our mobile phone.  

Now consider there are multiple devices on the same network, then every device  
has its own IP address which is unknown to the outside internet,  
the router is only public ip address known to the outside internet.  

So how does router know which device requested which webpage/resource?  
Router maintains a IP table, which keeps track of the webpage requested  
and responds in similar fashion like key-value mapping.  

NAT Table also uses port number which  
phone might be mapped 192.168.1.2:5000 -> 203.113.5.5000  
laptop might be mapped 192.168.1.3:5000 -> 203.113.5.5002  

both devices uses same port but router can distinguish these devices.
